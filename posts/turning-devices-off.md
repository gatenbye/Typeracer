<p>Leaving devices on when they're not in use is another form of energy waste. Certain devices will turn off or go sleep after a certain time but humans are impatient and will often leave things running to avoid having to wait for start up times. It is best to put devices to sleep if you plan on being away from them for extended periods of time. </p>
