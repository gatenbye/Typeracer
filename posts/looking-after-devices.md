<p>Old devices are hard to recycle. One should try to replace one's devices only when they are no longer functioning and not with the latest trends! Batteries discharge by being plugged in for too long and overcharging batteries is needless waste. One should charge devices before they run completely out of battery and not after they are fully charged. </p>
